# C-LSTM-neural-network-for-text-classification
A C-LSTM neural network for text classification with attention, a neural architecture for solving classification task using union of convolutional(CNN) and recurrent neural network(RNN).


Following are the results of multiclass text classification on [BBC Dataset](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html)
  * Test set accuracy with only CNN: 96.33%
  * Test set accuracy with only LSTM: 95.8% 
  * Test set accuracy with C-LSTM: 97.27%
